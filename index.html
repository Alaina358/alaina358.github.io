	<h2>Experiences</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/i2c.jpeg" alt="" width="120px" height="140px"/></span>
								As a Java-focused Software Engineer, I specialize in the full lifecycle of software development, particularly in crafting and testing microservices using Spring Boot. My role involves designing efficient microservices and ensuring their seamless integration into complex systems. I'm also responsible for quality assurance and have improved our deployment processes, enhancing our continuous integration practices, leading to more efficient development cycles and higher software quality.
								</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/packages.jpg" alt="" width="120px" height="120px"/></span>As an intern in a large-scale organization, I analyzed data and crafted reports for strategic insights, while collaborating with a diverse team on technology-driven marketing campaigns. This role provided a deep dive into the company's operations, enhancing my understanding of its complex system. I also expanded my technical skills by learning DevOps and Laravel, gaining valuable experience in continuous integration and web application development, all within a rich, diverse working environment.
							</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/FL.png" alt="" width="120px" height="120px"/></span>As an intern, I played a pivotal role in managing and developing a website dedicated to analyzing inventory performance. This task involved intricate design and implementation work, particularly in creating a research-focused website using React for internal use. Collaborating with multi-background teams, I contributed both technically and creatively, ensuring the website was not only functional but also user-friendly and aligned with our research objectives. This experience sharpened my skills in web development and team collaboration, providing a comprehensive understanding of how diverse skill sets can synergize to produce impactful internal tools
							</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/iet.png" alt="" width="120px" height="120px"/></span>
								I spearheaded the organization of transformational internal events by guiding cross-functional teams.
								 My role involved not just coordination, but also strategic planning to ensure these events 
								 had a meaningful impact on participants. Additionally, I launched various programs aimed at
								  upskilling peers, focusing on enhancing their professional and personal competencies.
								   This initiative contributed significantly to their growth and development within the organization.

								In parallel, I initiated and led awareness campaigns on campus.
								These campaigns were designed to not only inform but also engage potential students,
								 showcasing the unique opportunities and experiences our institution offers. 
								 My efforts in these areas demonstrate a commitment to organizational growth,
								  peer development, and effective leadership in driving significant positive change.
